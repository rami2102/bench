there are scripts here that doing swe-bench to compare 4 ai coding agents: pi, claude, codex, gemini. The challenge that swe-bench have only 1 software language, we want to create a new suit based on free for commercial use open sources in githu, that tests at least 6 software languages and include at least: javascript, typesecript, python, c++, java. Nice to have software languages: bash, R, go, SQL , rust (only after above finished). the new suit scripts must be in seperate subfolder like: scripts/languages/. make research on github which ones are the best, than write all needed scripts to do chosen number of tests for each ai coding agent, the tests should be ordered by capturing as many variaty as we want of software languages for every number of tests we choose to run, either by chossing the test names from big file of tests (eg: ini / md / json file)  or by picking the amount of tests and than it will be someting like: test software labguage 1, test langugae 2, ... test last language N, difffernt test for language 1, different test language 2, ... test last differnt language N, etc.
